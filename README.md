This Restroom Revolution mobile web site was created by Kelly Thompson, Kassi Smith, and Bennett Magnino (listed in reverse alphabetical order) for their Mobile Web Design course in the University of Iowa School of Library and Information Science under the instruction of Dr. Haowei Hsieh. The idea for the app came from Avi Deol, a student in the University of Iowa School of Social Work. Avi started a campus-based group named Restroom Revolution in the spring of 2013 to collect data on accessbility features in campus restrooms, with an eye toward assisting community members to find bathrooms on the fly which fit their needs. If you have suggestions for improvement of this app or other feedback for the development team, please contact Restroom Revolution through their facebook group.
