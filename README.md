# restroom-revolution
Restroom Revolution is a mobile web site created to enable people to find gender-inclusive, accessible, and parenting-friendly restrooms on the University of Iowa campus.

This mobile web site was created by Kelly Thompson, Kassi Smith, and Bennett Magnino (listed in reverse alphabetical order) for their Mobile Web Design course in the University of Iowa School of Library and Information Science under the instruction of Dr. Haowei Hsieh. The idea for the app came from Avi Deol, a student in the University of Iowa School of Social Work. Avi started a campus-based group named Restroom Revolution in the spring of 2013 to collect data on accessbility features in campus restrooms, with an eye toward assisting community members to find bathrooms on the fly which fit their needs. You can find this group on facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/152151204948156/">here</a>.

PLEASE NOTE: This app is no longer under active development.  However, we are contributing the code here so that others may reuse it under the specified license terms for the benefit of our communities.
